                "description": "Developer Sloclap's hit action game Sifu proudly showcases its inspirations in its level design, combat, and more. But, as demonstrated by Sifu's first proper level The Squats, those movie references go beyond mere homage. The developers found clever ways to use those references in ways that teach the player how to fight against Sifu's brutally difficult foes.\r\n\r\nIGN's Mitchell Saltzman, as well as members of the Sloclap development team, take you through The Squats and break down how the level is built to not only include major callouts to films like Oldboy and more but also how it elevates those homages to deepen the player's understanding of how to adapt and survive to Sifu's gameplay mechanics. It's a careful tightrope walk of both reverence and a desire to carve out Sifu's own identity, and Sloclap pulled it off.\r\n\r\nThis is Art of the Level",

But what does this new merger mean? Will the Discovery/WB merger raise the price of HBO Max? So the question here is, will you stick with #HBOMax if there's a price increase due to the WB/Discovery merger? If they play the game right, similar to how we've seen with Netflix over the years, they'll have small incremental price increases over time. Continuing on with the merger conversation, WB/Discovery CEO David Zaslav also wants to bring new life to DC properties and overhaul what's been brewing in the pot. And finally, out with Ezra and in with Grant, as fans are demanding the CW star replace his silver screen counterpart as The Flash.",

                "description": "Hideo Kojima may have woken up and decided to troll the world this morning when he posted a tweet alluding to having joined PlayStation Studios. Hideo Kojima set the Twitter world ablaze when #HideoKojima posted a picture of the PlayStation Studios banner with games from all of Sony's First party studios including Death Stranding. The cryptic tweet sparked speculation that Kojima Productions may have officially joined #PlayStation Studios. In other video game news, Horizon Forbidden West's Creative Director says Guerilla Games is already set up for a sequel to the open-world game. Speaking with VG24/7, the creative director said that, just as Horizon: Zero Dawn set up the story for Forbidden West, seeds have been planted for the third game as well. Horizon Forbidden West ends with another big cliffhanger, apparently serving as a setup for the next installment to continue. And finally, IGN is teaming up with Rogue to create a new video game reality show with the grand prize winner getting a publishing deal with Rogue.",
